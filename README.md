# Snake? Snaaaaaake!

Just a simple Snake game for your browser

It's not yet complete, but is playable _somehow_.

## Why?

This is only a playground to get React and Redux working, and because I always wanted to code a Snake game.

## How to play

1. Clone the code
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run server`
1. Open it at http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/www`
1. Click inside the browser page to get focus

## Controls

- Arrows
- WASD
- Vim movement controls (HJKL)

## Next steps
