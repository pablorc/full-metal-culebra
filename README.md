# Snake? Snaaaaaake!

Just a simple Snake game for your browser

It's not yet complete, but is playable _somehow_.

## Why?

This is only a playground to get React and Redux working, and because I always wanted to code a Snake game.

## Contribute

Sure! Just ping me at Twitter ([@pablorc](https://twitter.com/pablorc)) and let's talk. Do you want a colleage to make a bigger game? I'm in!

## And remember
